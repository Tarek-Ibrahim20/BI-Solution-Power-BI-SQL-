# Business Intelligence Project by SQL and Power BI 
This business intelligence project was a multifaceted and demanding initiative that yielded highly rewarding outcomes.
This business intelligence project involved connecting to the AdventureWorks SQL Server database to create essential data views and fact tables using T-SQL. Transforming and cleansing data was streamlined with Power Query, while a custom date dimension was constructed using DAX. Advanced DAX measures and time intelligence functions were developed for in-depth data analysis, and using Power BI advanced capabilities

Data transformation and cleansing were efficiently carried out using Power Query, enhancing the overall data quality.
A pivotal component of this project was the creation of date dimension employing DAX, which significantly enriched the analytical capabilities of the solution. To delve deeper into the data, advanced DAX measures and time intelligence functions were meticulously developed, enabling sophisticated data analysis and interpretation.
